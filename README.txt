Hi,
I'm Rage ore better Ragebone and this is my littel Github RageWorld where I will publish scripts I myself did develope

Have fun,
Descriptions in every  subsystem. 

CAUTION:
Due to changes in the Systems to a better perfomat system, i made a Mistake based  rooted in the ground idea.
The Problem is that th return status of both systems gets stored in a single global variable.
This leads to problems when more then one vehicle has indicator on  and can cause the indicatros not to shine.

same applies to the newest not tested Siren update, done on the 15th of February 2015.

I am of cause aware of the problem!
